Here is your Data Residency Map template configured for Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), natively incorporating NDPR (Nigeria), POPIA (South Africa), and the Kenya Data Protection Act (DPA, often read alongside KICA for electronic systems). [1, 2] 
Since AWS has an infrastructure region in South Africa (af-south-1) and GCP has a cloud region in Johannesburg (africa-south1), these are prioritized as your core anchoring environments for localized African data compliance. [3]

## Data Residency & Sovereignty Map: African Operations

* Last Updated: 2026-08-27
* Primary Infrastructure Providers: Amazon Web Services (AWS) & Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* Compliance Jurisdictions:
* Nigeria: NDPR (Nigeria Data Protection Regulation) / NDPA 2023
   * South Africa: POPIA (Protection of Personal Information Act)
   * Kenya: Data Protection Act, 2019 (DPA) & KICA (Kenya Information and Communications Act) [1, 2] 

------------------------------
## 1. Executive Summary
This document ensures strict adherence to cross-border transfer laws and local storage requirements across our core African markets. Personal data originating from South Africa, Kenya, and Nigeria is dynamically isolated or bound to regional nodes with strict transit security.

* Primary Processing Strategy: Hybrid AWS/GCP architecture deploying localized clusters.
* Sovereignty Mandate: Where local hosting is not viable, cryptographic adequacy (AES-256 with Customer Managed Keys) is enforced prior to cross-border routing. [4] 

------------------------------
## 2. Infrastructure Footprint Matrix

| Cloud Provider | Region Name | Code | Primary Compliance Role | Target Data Subjects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AWS | Africa (Cape Town) | af-south-1 | Primary Storage & Identity | South Africa / Southern Africa |
| GCP | South Africa (Johannesburg) | africa-south1 | Core Analytics & Microservices | South Africa / Regional Hub |
| AWS | Europe (Frankfurt) | eu-central-1 | Fallback Node & Escrow | Kenya / Nigeria (Adequate Jurisdiction) |
| GCP | Europe (Paris) | europe-west9 | Transient Web Processing Edge | Global / Pan-African Ingress |

------------------------------
## 3. Data Categories & Residency Mapping

| Data Category | Relevant Regulation | Primary Cloud & Location | Sovereignty / Handling Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| PII / User Profiles (South Africa) | POPIA Section 72 | GCP africa-south1 (Joburg) | Must remain local unless recipient country has an adequacy agreement or binding corporate rules. |
| National Identifier Data (Kenya) | Kenya DPA / KICA | AWS af-south-1 (With local cache) | Mandatory local server copy requirement. Strategic operational server copy stays in-continent. |
| Financial / Transactional (Nigeria) | NDPR / CBN Guidelines | AWS eu-central-1 (Frankfurt) | Cloud allowed via verified Data Transfer Impact Assessment (DTIA) & Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). |
| Unified Auth & IAM Logs | General Protection | AWS af-south-1 (Primary) | Replicated globally with strict zero-knowledge envelope encryption. |

------------------------------
## 4. Regional Data Flows & Sovereignty Controls

## South Africa (POPIA)

* Hosting Environment: GCP (africa-south1) & AWS (af-south-1) [3] 
* Sovereignty Rule: Conditions for lawful processing dictate that account numbers, special personal information, and child data are strictly localized within South African data centers.
* Cross-Border Interception: Any processing outside the borders utilizes Cloud Armor Geo-Based Access Restrictions to prevent unauthorized exposure. [5] 

## Kenya (DPA 2019 & KICA)

* Hosting Environment: AWS Africa Region with local edge caching. [6] 
* Sovereignty Rule: To satisfy the legal requirement of retaining at least one serving copy of personal data within the territorial jurisdiction of Kenya, processing uses localized content nodes or encrypted cloud boundaries. [6] 
* Breach Notification Constraint: Data processors must report breaches to the controller within 48 hours; controllers report to the ODPC within 72 hours. [7] 

## Nigeria (NDPR)

* Hosting Environment: AWS & GCP Europe Regions (Frankfurt/Paris).
* Sovereignty Rule: Cross-border transfers to cloud environments outside Nigeria are authorized based on the NDPC's whitelist of adequate jurisdictions (EU/GDPR framework is recognized).
* Encryption Requirement: All metadata passing outside Nigeria must use Customer Managed Encryption Keys (AWS KMS / GCP Cloud KMS) where keys never leave corporate custody.

------------------------------
## 5. Security & Technical Compliance Overrides

* Isolation Mechanisms: AWS Organizations and GCP Assured Workloads are deployed to prevent developer resource provisioning outside designated geographic boundaries.
* Audit Trail: Infrastructure logs are consolidated via Google Cloud BigQuery and AWS CloudTrail into an immutable, read-only audit bucket situated in Cape Town for regional regulatory inspection. [8]
